## Optimization of the ms distribution
The spintorch folder contains the costum micromagnetic solver SpinTorch.

Run the WD_alpha7p9_CloseOutput.py file, and check the the optimized Ms distribution in the Msat_s_WD_alpha7p9_CloseOutput.mat file or in the plots folder. Since it would run for a long time i uploaded my result as Msat_s_WD_alpha7p9_CloseOutput.mat.
