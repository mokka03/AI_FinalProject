# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Final Project

### Requirements
The python code was tested with PyTorch 1.10.1, Python 3.7.6, CUDA 11.3, and up-to-date versions of a few other standard packages, older versions might not work out-of-the-box. It can run on both CPU and GPU (Nvidia), but GPU operation is preferred, CPU is much slower and not tested. GPU requirements are the same as required by PyTorch.
